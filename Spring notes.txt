Spring notes:

Spring is framework of framework 
>>> Because it has various type of sub-module
	Sprinng security,
	spring Boot,
	Spring MVC,
	Spring Cloud,
	Spring Data,
	others(IOC,AOP,DAO,Context,ORM,WEB MVC)

it is lightweight
it help to create a loosely coupled application
it is open source
it provide infrastructure that support for developing J2EE application


Advantages of Spring Framework:
1) it provide predefine template for JDBC, Hibernnate, JPA etc
2) loose Coupling because dependency injection
3) Easy to test 
4) Lightweight because of POJO implementation 
5) Fast development
6) powerfull abstraction to javaEE specification such as JMS JDBC JPA

Dependency Injection:
1) It is a design pattern that removes the dependency from programming code so that it can be 
   easy to manage and test application.
2) It make our programming code loosely coupled by removing dependencies 


IOC (Inversion of Control) container: 
1) It is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects.
2) It gets information form XML file, 
	                    Annotation based configuration, 
			    java based configuration and work accordingly.

There are three main operation that perform IOC Container
1) To instantiate the application class
2) To configure the object
3) To assemble the dependencies between the objects.


Types of spring dependency injection:
1) Setter Dependency Injection
2) Constructor Dependency Injection


Core Spring Annotation:
1) @SpringBootApplication 
	it is a combination of 3 different annotation 
	@EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan + @Configuration

2) @Configuration
3) @Been
4) @Autowired
5) @Component
	@Controller(Component,MVC Controller) - presentation Layer
	@Sevice(business logic) --- service Layer
	@Repository(DAO classes) -- DAO Layer

6) @ComponentScan
7) @qualifier
8) @lazy
9) @Controller
10) @ResponseBody
11) @RequestBody
